# SQL_Bixi_Project
This project analyzes the public Bixi bike dataset found at https://www.bixi.com/en/open-data. The goal is to gain a high level understanding of how people use Bixi bikes, what factors influence the volume of usage, popular stations, and overall business growth.

The project is broken down into two sections: 
- Basic data analysis using SQL (bixi-deliverable.sql)
- Further analysis and dashboarding using Tableau (Bixi Deliverable 2.twb)

Both sections include their own respective business reports which seek to understand the findings of each analysis and provide further actionable insghts:
- Bixi Deliverable Report.pdf
- Bixi Deliverable 2.pdf
